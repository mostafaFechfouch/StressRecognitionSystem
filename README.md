<h1> Stress Recognition System</h1>
<img src="static/img/logo.png" alt="Logo" style="width:5%;height:1%">
<p><b>De-Stress</b> is an IoT system that is able to detect a patient's stress based on physiological measurements of his body (ECG, EMG, Heart Rate, and Breathing Rate). The data was acquired using the MySignals HW v2.0 eHealth platform and then sent to a machine learning model deployed into a REST API to get the state of the patient either stressed or not and act according to his situation.
In this project, I have learned and acquired many new skills in different domains such as machine learning, the Internet of Things, and web development.
